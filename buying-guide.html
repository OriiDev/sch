            <h2>Complete Guide to Buying a Car</h2>
            <p>
                Purchasing a car is one of the biggest decisions you'll make. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate 
                the process and find the perfect vehicle for your needs.
            </p>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 1: Determine Your Budget</h3>
                <p>
                    Before you start shopping, establish a realistic budget. Consider not just the purchase price, but also 
                    insurance, fuel, maintenance, and registration fees. A common rule is to spend no more than 10-15% of 
                    your annual income on a car purchase.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 2: Identify Your Needs</h3>
                <p>
                    Think about what you actually need in a vehicle:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Type:</strong> Sedan, SUV, truck, coupe, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Gasoline, hybrid, electric, or diesel</li>
                    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Compact, midsize, or full-size</li>
                    <li><strong>Features:</strong> Tech, comfort, performance, or efficiency</li>
                    <li><strong>Seating:</strong> Number of passengers and cargo space needed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 3: Research Models</h3>
                <p>
                    Read reviews, compare specifications, and check reliability ratings from sources like J.D. Power 
                    and Edmunds. Look at owner reviews and reliability data to find models that match your criteria.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 4: New vs. Used</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>New Cars:</strong> Full warranty, latest features, but higher depreciation and cost<br>
                    <strong>Used Cars:</strong> Lower price, slower depreciation, but may have hidden issues and no warranty
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 5: Inspection and Test Drive</h3>
                <p>
                    Always test drive a vehicle before purchasing. For used cars, get a pre-purchase inspection from 
                    a trusted mechanic. Check the vehicle history using resources like CarFax or AutoCheck.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 6: Financing Options</h3>
                <p>
                    Compare financing options before visiting the dealer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bank Loans:</strong> Often offer competitive rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Union Loans:</strong> May offer better terms for members</li>
                    <li><strong>Dealer Financing:</strong> Convenient but sometimes more expensive</li>
                    <li><strong>Leasing:</strong> Lower monthly payments but with mileage restrictions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 7: Negotiation</h3>
                <p>
                    Don't accept the first price offered. Research fair market value using tools like Edmunds, Kelley 
                    Blue Book, or NADA Guides. Be prepared to negotiate and walk away if the deal isn't right.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h3>Step 8: Insurance and Registration</h3>
                <p>
                    Get insurance quotes before finalizing your purchase. Budget for registration and title transfer fees, 
                    which vary by state. Make sure you understand warranty coverage and roadside assistance options.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>

                <br>
