            <h2>Essential Car Maintenance Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Regular maintenance is crucial for keeping your vehicle safe, reliable, and running at peak performance. 
                Follow these essential maintenance tasks to extend your car's lifespan.
            </p>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Oil Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Every 3,000-7,000 miles (depending on oil type and vehicle)<br>
                    Oil changes are one of the most important maintenance tasks. Fresh oil keeps your engine lubricated 
                    and prevents premature wear. Always use the grade recommended in your owner's manual.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Tire Maintenance</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Monthly pressure checks, rotation every 6,000-8,000 miles<br>
                    Check tire pressure monthly and rotate tires regularly to ensure even wear. Proper tire maintenance 
                    improves fuel efficiency and safety. Replace tires when tread depth reaches 2/32 inch.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Air Filter Replacement</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Every 15,000-30,000 miles<br>
                    A clean air filter improves engine performance and fuel efficiency. Inspect your air filter every 
                    oil change and replace it when it becomes clogged with dirt and debris.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Brake Inspection</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Every 50,000 miles or as needed<br>
                    Regular brake inspections ensure your safety. Check brake pads for wear, inspect rotors for damage, 
                    and have brake fluid checked and replaced according to manufacturer specifications.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Battery Check</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Annually, especially before winter<br>
                    Check your battery terminals for corrosion and ensure they're clean and tight. Most batteries last 
                    3-5 years. Have your battery tested regularly to avoid unexpected failures.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="maintenance-section">
                <h3>Fluid Levels</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency:</strong> Monthly<br>
                    Check coolant, transmission fluid, brake fluid, and windshield washer fluid regularly. Low fluid 
                    levels can indicate leaks or other problems that need attention.
